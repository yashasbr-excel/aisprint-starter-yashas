# Tailwind CSS Rules

## Tailwind Configuration

- The Tailwind configuration is located at `tailwind.config.ts`.
- All CSS imports should be in the `src/app/globals.css` file.

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes directly on components.
- Do not write custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- Follow the component styling guidelines for consistency.
